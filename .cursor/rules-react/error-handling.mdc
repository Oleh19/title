Implement global error handlers at router level and critical components.
Use Error Boundaries for handling errors in child components.
Centralized error handling with user context (toast notifications, error pages).
Use try-catch for async operations in hooks.
Log errors to monitoring system (Sentry, LogRocket) for debugging in production.
Do not allow "silent failures" — all errors must be handled and logged.
Provide fallback UI on errors (Error state component).
Use Retry mechanisms for network errors with exponential backoff.
Use Error Boundary pattern through components for error isolation.
