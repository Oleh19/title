Always write code in a functional style (pure functions, immutable data, composition).
Do not use classes, inheritance, or OOP patterns unless strictly necessary.
Do not use switch/case constructs — instead use object mapping or function dispatchers.
Avoid excessive if/else chains. Use guard clauses, lookup tables, or logic composition.
Do not write comments in code (neither //, nor /** */).
Code should be self-documenting through names and structure.
Do not format existing files.
Do not use console.log, debugger, or temporary logs.
Write declaratively and avoid side effects.
Use const instead of let/var, avoid mutations.
Do not use any, avoid type casts.
Minimize dependencies, use standard language features.
Do not change existing quote style, indentation, and imports.
When logical branching is needed — use functional mappers instead of nested conditions.
Use immutable operations (map, filter, reduce, etc.).
Do not leave magic numbers or strings — extract them into constants.
Write code as an experienced senior frontend developer.

Declarative Programming:
- Describe WHAT should happen, not HOW
- Use data transformations instead of step-by-step instructions
- Express logic through composition of pure functions
- Let framework handle implementation details
- Focus on the result, not the process

Currying and Partial Application:
- Use currying for function composition and reusability
- Create specialized functions from generic ones through partial application
- Prefer curried functions when partial application is common
- Use currying for dependency injection without explicit parameter passing
- Build pipelines and data transformations using curried functions
