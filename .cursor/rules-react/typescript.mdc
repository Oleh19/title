Require TypeScript strict mode.
No exceptions for noImplicitAny unless explicitly justified.
Distinguish DTO (types for API) and Domain (domain types).
dto/ types are located next to adapters.
model/ types are canonical domain types.
Convert DTO → Domain only in adapter/service layer.
Use readonly, as const, branded types where semantic difference is important.
When using any, add `// TODO: justify use of any` and annotate the risk.

Automatically create and maintain `index.ts` files in each folder with exportable modules (components, hooks, utilities).
Update barrel files when adding, removing, or renaming files in feature folders.
Include only files with exports (skip tests, stories, mocks).
Use named exports everywhere possible.
For default exports use syntax: `export { default as ComponentName } from "./ComponentName"`.
For type-only files use: `export type { MyType } from "./types"`.
Skip files: `.test.ts`, `.spec.ts`, `.stories.tsx`, `.mock.ts`, `index.ts/tsx`.
Never use `export *` if module contains side-effects.
Always maintain alphabetical order of exports.
Generate relative paths without extensions: `"./MyComponent"`.
Create aggregating `index.ts` for feature folders that re-export from subfolders (ui, hooks, api, model).
Maintain one barrel file per folder boundary.
Do not create global barrel files in project root.
Consider TypeScript path aliases when generating paths.
